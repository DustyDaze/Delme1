# Delme1

ASP.Net Core Wep App - uses GitHub for source control & GitHub actions to create a CI/CD pipeline deploying to a website hosted on an Azure web service:

- App Service: Delme1 
- App Service Plan: AppSrv-Delme1

The pipeline implemented from a YAML file which produces a zip package containing the deployment for that run.
